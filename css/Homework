1,2,10,6,100


if number 2 is bigger than No1

delet no1 

if no 10 is bigger than no.2

delet no.2

if no 6 is smaller than 10
keep number 10 and continue to the next number


x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6
1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 26

x= x2+1=7x3



----------------------
nice number


sum(x,y)=z

if x=10 and y=2 the result is xy=12
